            The Society was founded in 1960 in time to celebrate the town's
            250th anniversary in 1961. The founders stated the objects of the
            Society were the collecting of facts and material relative to the
            history of Norton and encouragement of any cultural activities.

            In the early 1970's the District 3 Schoolhouse was moved to its
            present location on West Main Street and is now the Society's
            headquarters. The interior has been restored with part replicating
            an old school room and part a museum of objects relevant to Norton's
            history. The Society receives and preserves old documents, books,
            furniture and artifacts related to this region.
